# YOLO: A Single Pass to Detect & Identify Objects

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for "YOLO: A Single Pass to Detect & Identify Objects," a project completed as part of a seminar in the Electrical Engineering Department at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat.

## Overview

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. Unlike other detection systems that repurpose classifiers to perform detection, YOLO applies a single neural network to the full image. This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. YOLO is extremely fast and can process images in real-time, making it ideal for applications requiring rapid detection.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Capable of processing images and video in real-time.
- **High Accuracy:** Predicts multiple bounding boxes and their probabilities.
- **Versatile Applications:** Used in autonomous driving, surveillance, traffic management, and more.
- **Progressive Learning:** The model improves over time, increasing its prediction accuracy.

## Abstract

Object detection involves locating and identifying objects within images or videos. YOLO stands out by applying a single neural network to the entire image, predicting bounding boxes and probabilities directly. This approach enables YOLO to perform object detection with high accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time applications such as video surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and more.

## Introduction

Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from face recognition to autonomous driving. Traditional methods often involve complex, multi-step processes, but YOLO simplifies this by predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single evaluation. This section introduces the basics of object detection, its features, challenges, and various applications.

## YOLO Algorithm

The YOLO algorithm processes images in a single pass, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict multiple bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. This section covers the evolution of YOLO from v1 to the latest versions, highlighting key improvements such as better handling of small objects, increased localization accuracy, and enhanced network architectures.

### YOLO Upgradations

- **YOLOv2:** Introduced batch normalization and anchor boxes, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) and handling multiple objects per grid cell.
- **YOLO9000:** Combined classification and detection tasks, enabling the detection of over 9000 object categories.
- **YOLOv3:** Used a 106-layer neural network (DarkNet-53) and predicted at three different scales for better detection of small objects.
- **YOLOv4:** Implemented methodological modifications like Weighted Residual Connections and Cross Stage Partial Connections to further improve performance.

## Implementation

YOLO's implementation involves several steps, including data preparation, network architecture design, training, and evaluation. This section provides detailed guidance on setting up and running the YOLO model, with code snippets and configuration tips to help users deploy YOLO for various detection tasks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the YOLO version used)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-detection.git
    cd yolo-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Organize and annotate images for training.
    - Use tools like LabelImg to create XML files for each image.

2. **Training:**
    - Configure the YOLO model parameters in the configuration file (e.g., `yolov3.cfg`).
    - Train the network using your annotated data:
        ```bash
        python train.py --data data_config.yaml --cfg yolov3.cfg --weights weights/yolov3.weights
        ```

3. **Evaluation:**
    - Test the model on new images or video:
        ```bash
        python detect.py --source data/images --weights weights/yolov3.weights --cfg yolov3.cfg
        ```

## Applications

YOLO's fast and accurate detection capabilities have made it popular across multiple domains:

- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Detects vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real-time.
- **Surveillance:** Monitors and tracks people and objects for security purposes.
- **Traffic Management:** Helps manage and monitor traffic flow and detect accidents.
- **Industrial Automation:** Ensures product quality on production lines.
- **Robotics:** Enables robots to perceive and interact with their environment.

## Conclusion

YOLO's single-pass detection system offers a significant advancement in real-time object detection. Its high speed and accuracy make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from autonomous driving to industrial automation. Continuous upgrades and improvements in the YOLO algorithm ensure it remains at the forefront of object detection technology.
